# About

This is macro mod that is programmed to start steam, go to the library page, start elden ring, and navigate to the Mohgwyn palace bird farm. It requires to have a bow already in the hand, arrows already equiped in the top two slots. It will farm for about 7.7 hours if fully equiped with arrows and get in total about 18 million runes. It first starts with user interace and will navigate through steam even if you have it on a different start page. 

# Usage

This program is made for windows 10 (used when finding the windows icon) and requires a couple of pip installes, this also runs fully on python.
pip install pyautogui
pip install pydirectinput
pip install pyscreeze
pip install pymsbox
pip install opencv-python
pip install pillow

This also requires a couple of screen shots that are included that you should keep in the same directory as the macro. You can login through the gui's with either alex or lincoln in the username page and "macrobot" in the password page. You also MUST have anti cheat turned off for elden ring, you can look up a video detailing how to do this.
Thank you.
